# 2014 CCIE Class Notes

Notes from a CCIE class I attended in 2014.  I'd posted most of these on https://feralpacket.org.

Uploaded the Evernote .enex exports.

Note-to-self:
 - Github doesn't like files that are bigger than 25 MB.
 - Need to add pictures of hand drawn diagrams to:
   - DMVPN
   - L2VPN
 - L2VPN Interworking, VPLS configuration needs to be added
